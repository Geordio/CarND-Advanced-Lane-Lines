Camera Calibration
The calibration images in the lesson exercise were taken with a different camera setting and a different chessboard pattern than the calibration images for the project. You need to set your chessboard size to 9x6 for the project instead of 8x6 as in the lesson.

Sanity Check
Ok, so your algorithm found some lines. Before moving on, you should check that the detection makes sense. To confirm that your detected lane lines are real, you might consider:

Checking that they have similar curvature
Checking that they are separated by approximately the right distance horizontally
Checking that they are roughly parallel
